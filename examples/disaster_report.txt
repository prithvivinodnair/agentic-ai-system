CONSTRAINTS AND CHALLENGES
=================================================================

Time-Critical Factors:
- Golden window for rescue: 72 hours from earthquake
- Weather forecast: Major storm system arriving in 96 hours
- Aftershock risk: High probability in next 48-72 hours

Resource Limitations:
- Medical personnel shortage in affected areas
- Heavy equipment availability limited
- Fuel supplies for generators running low
- Shelter materials in high demand

Access Challenges:
- Multiple road closures impeding access
- Airport runways damaged in Metro Alpha
- Port facilities compromised in Coastal Gamma
- Contaminated water complicating operations

Coordination Issues:
- Multiple agencies requiring coordination
- Local government leadership disrupted
- Communication systems intermittent
- Public panic and misinformation spreading


=================================================================
DECISION REQUIREMENTS
=================================================================

IMMEDIATE (0-24 hours):
1. Resource allocation across three regions
2. Search & rescue prioritization
3. Emergency shelter deployment strategy
4. Medical triage and evacuation protocols
5. Communication and public information plan

SHORT-TERM (24-72 hours):
1. Infrastructure stabilization priorities
2. Supply chain establishment
3. Volunteer and donation management
4. Secondary hazard mitigation
5. Family reunification systems

MEDIUM-TERM (72 hours - 2 weeks):
1. Temporary housing deployment
2. Critical infrastructure restoration
3. Economic support programs
4. Mental health services deployment
5. Investigation and assessment teams

=================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS REQUIRED
=================================================================

This situation requires immediate national-scale operational
decisions on resource allocation, prioritization of response
efforts, and coordination of multi-agency operations.

Key decision points:
- How to distribute limited resources across regions with
  different severity levels and accessibility challenges
- Whether to prioritize life-saving operations vs. infrastructure
  stabilization
- How to balance immediate response with longer-term recovery
- Strategies for managing the approaching storm while continuing
  rescue operations

Decision-makers must consider:
- Ethical implications of resource allocation
- Political pressure for visible progress
- Media coverage and public perception
- International aid coordination
- Economic impact and recovery timeline
